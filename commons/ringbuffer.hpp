/* WARNING: This is a generic ringbuffer abstraction, which works for single-sized elements,
            partial elements, single/multi-elements read/writes. It is not wise to mix some
            functions (partial element write / full element write), since it was not designed
            with this use in mind.

            Also, it works only for single-reader + single-writer, since it does not depends
            on external mutex functions.
